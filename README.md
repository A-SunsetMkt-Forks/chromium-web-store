# chromium-web-store
Allows adding extensions from chrome web store on unsupported chromium derivatives like ungoogled-chromium.  
You can click the badge to check for updates to any web store extensions, it will also check automatically when you first start chromium.  
If you wish to install the extensions directly instead of just downloading them, you must change the flag `chrome://flags/#extension-mime-request-handling` to `Always prompt for install`.  
To install this extension, drag and drop the .crx into your `chrome://extensions` page.
