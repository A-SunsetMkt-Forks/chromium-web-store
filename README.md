# chromium-web-store
Allows adding extensions from chrome web store on unsupported chromium derivatives like ungoogled-chromium.  
If you wish to install the extensions directly instead of just downloading them, you must change the flag `chrome://flags/#extension-mime-request-handling` to `Always prompt for install`.  
To install this extension, drag and drop the .crx into your `chrome://extensions` page.
